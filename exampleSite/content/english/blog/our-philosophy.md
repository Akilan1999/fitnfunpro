**Tailor made Tennis programs for individuals and groups for up to 6 people**

Our Philosophy:

Playing tennis must be **FUN** while staying **HEALTHY** and improving your own **FITNESS** at the same time!

All tennis players are different and unless you are a Pro, it is impossible to learn the perfect technique. What might be good for Roger Federer might not be suitable for **YOU**…

We do not teach the perfect swing technique but the perfect swing technique for **YOU**!!

Our holistic approach does also include fitness exercises to avoid common injuries, stretching, warming up and the mental aspect of playing tennis.

After a 3 – or 5 days camp you will see improvement of your game and you’ll start the season at home with more fun and wins.
