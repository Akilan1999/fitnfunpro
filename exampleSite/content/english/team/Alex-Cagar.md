Chris (Christian) Wind has been coaching for 35 years first in his native Austria, then in Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, Thailand and most recently in Dubai.

He brings a wealth of experience with him having coached in various set ups from local clubs to schools, tennis camps and 5* start hotels working with kids and adults of all kind of levels - from absolute beginners to competitive players.

Chris still practices tennis almost every day and has been competing on the ITF Seniors Tour for the past 10 years and have won various singles and doubles titles. He reached top 30 world ranking in singles and top 15 in doubles in the men 50 and over category.

His coaching philosophy is that every individual needs an individual approach and the process of learning should be enjoyable. A fit for all scheme might be technically correct but noticeable progress can take an exceedingly long time and can be frustrating.
