  title: Our Philosophy
  content: "Playing tennis must be FUN while staying HEALTHY and improving your own
    FITNESS at the same time!\n\nAll tennis players are different and unless you are
    a Pro, it is impossible to learn the perfect technique. What might be good for
    Roger Federer might not be suitable for YOU…\n\nWe do not teach the perfect swing
    technique but the perfect swing technique for YOU!!\n\nOur holistic approach does
    also include fitness exercises to avoid common injuries, stretching, warming up
    and the mental aspect of playing tennis.\n\nAfter a 3 – or 5 days camp you will
    see improvement of your game and you’ll start the season at home with more fun
    and wins. "
